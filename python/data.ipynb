    "Python has several built-in data types. Here are some of the most common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) NoneType: This is a special data type that represents the absence of a value. It is similar to null in other languages.\n",
    "ii) Numbers: These can be integers, floating-point numbers, or complex numbers.\n",
    "iii) Booleans: These are values that represent True or False.\n",
    "iv) Lists: These are ordered collections of objects, enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "v) Tuples: These are similar to lists, but are immutable (i.e., their contents cannot be changed), and are enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "vi) Sets: These are unordered collections of unique elements, enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "vii) Strings: These are sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "viii) Ranges: These are immutable sequences of numbers, and are commonly used to iterate over a sequence of numbers in a for loop.\n",
    "ix) Dictionaries: These are collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.\n",
